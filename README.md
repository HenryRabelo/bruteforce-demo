A demonstration written in Python of the concept of bruteforcing a website or email login, assigned as a pet project for my work. It is not meant to be used as a practical tool, but as an educational demonstration.

#### I do not condone its use in a way that breaks the law, as it was made entirely for educational purposes.
The software is offered as is, and **I do not** take responsibility for its misuse.
